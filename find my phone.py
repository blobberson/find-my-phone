 **Title:** The Theme of Alienation in Kazuo Ishiguro's *Never Let Me Go*  

 **Preface** Kazuo Ishiguro's 2005 novel *Never Let Me Go* addresses the issue of alienation in the lives of Kathy H. and her friends Tommy and Ruth.  It lack a distinct identity and social position because they are clones made for the purpose of organ donation.  The novel is a reflection of their existential and psychological alienation, reflecting larger issues with loss of control, social marginalization, and human ethics.  This paper investigates Ishiguro's use of setting, characters, and narrative methodology to portray a vacuum.  ### **The Clones' Alienation**

One of the most important ways that Ishiguro presents alienation is in the clones' limited lives at Hailsham and elsewhere. Kathy and her friends are prepared from the start to resign themselves to their destiny as organ donors, but they are also shielded from the rest of society. They exist in a closed world that does not allow them to have ordinary human contact. The physical and mental isolation from the rest of society serves to underscore their alienation.
Ishiguro introduces this theme subtly in the narrative tone of Kathy. She recounts the events of her life in a detached, almost emotionless manner, which is indicative of the suppression of her emotions. This detachment is apparent when she discusses the "completions" of her friends, which is what they call their deaths following a sequence of organ donations. That they use such euphemistic language helps to further emphasize their dehumanization and detachment from the rest of society.

 **Symbolism and Setting**

The environment in the novel plays a significant role in depicting alienation.
Hailsham, initially presented as an idyllic boarding school, reveals itself to be an institution designed to shelter the clones while keeping them unaware of their doomed fate. The contrast between the peaceful environment of Hailsham and the grim future for clones helps to highlight the tragic irony of their existence. When Kathy and Tommy visit Madame's home later to ask for a deferral, they encounter a cold and rejecting universe that reaffirms their position as outsiders. Madame's reaction to them—her obvious discomfort and regret—reaffirms their status as outsiders. ### **The Role of Memory and Acceptance**

Ishiguro also uses memory as a tool for demonstrating alienation. Kathy's account consists of broken memories, which are often unsure and nostalgic. Her constant reminiscing is a sign of her desire to understand her life and her inability to escape the alienation that has been imposed on her. Although she has come to accept her fate, the novel poses questions to readers regarding whether such acceptance is a mark of strength or a demonstration of internalized oppression.
 **Conclusion**

Alienation is presented as a prevailing theme in Kazuo Ishiguro's *Never Let Me Go* through the characters, setting, and narrative technique of the novel.
The clones' physical and social isolation from the rest of society, their subdued emotional responses, and the metaphorical settings reinforce their alienation. Ishiguro's tragic tale forces readers to confront questions about ethics, humanness, and the consequences of societal exclusion. Ultimately, the novel is a haunting exploration of what it means to be human and what happens when humans are marginalized from society. ### **Works Cited**
